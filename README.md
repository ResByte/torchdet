Object Detection in Pytorch using Faster RCNN model 

The following method support different backbones : 
- resnet50 
- resnet101 
- resnet152 

- use `train.py` to launch training
- use `config.py` to update parameters 
- use `dataset.py` has generic dataset class, modify it according to dataset 
- use `augment.py` to update augmentation strategies. It uses albumentations.
